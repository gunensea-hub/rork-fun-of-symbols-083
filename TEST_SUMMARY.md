### 🔄 STEP 4: AI Refresh Button
- ✅ Tests the refresh functionality
- ✅ Makes multiple requests to simulate refresh
- ✅ Verifies fresh results are returned
- ✅ Confirms refresh button behavior

**Test Result Example:**
```
✅ AI Refresh working - Got 5 and 5 results
   Refresh result: Water Molecule (H2O) - 3D Structure
```

### ⚡ STEP 5: Compare Button Functionality
- ✅ Tests the AI comparison feature
- ✅ Calls the AI comparison endpoint
- ✅ Validates JSON response structure
- ✅ Confirms connections are found
- ✅ Checks comparison result completeness

**Test Result Example:**

   Connection: Both symbols represent protection and preservation
   Target: Benzene Ring (C6H6)
```

### 🖼️ STEP 6: Image Loading
- ✅ Tests Wikipedia Commons image accessibility
- ✅ Verifies multiple test images load
- ✅ Checks image URL validity
- ✅ Confirms image availability

**Test Result Example:**
```
✅ Image Loading working - 3/3 images accessible
```
