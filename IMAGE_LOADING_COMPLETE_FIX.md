### 4. **ComparisonResult Component** (`components/ComparisonResult.tsx`)
- ✅ AI-enhanced images for matched symbols
- ✅ Automatic AI image search for comparison results
- ✅ Refresh functionality for better image quality
- ✅ Image source badges and descriptions

### 5. **Main App Integration** (`app/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Proper image load/error callback handling
- ✅ Compare button visibility tied to image loading success
- ✅ Integration with all image-enhanced components

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### **Multi-Layer Image Loading System:**
1. **Original Image** → Try the original source first
2. **Curated Database** → Fall back to verified Wikipedia Commons images
3. **AI Search** → Use AI to find relevant, verified images
4. **AI Generation** → Generate custom images as last resort
5. **Placeholder** → Show "Image not available" with retry options

### **AI-Powered Verification:**
- 🤖 Automatic AI image search with relevance scoring
- 🔍 Smart category detection (ancient symbols, chemical formulas, star clusters, etc.)
- ✅ Wikipedia Commons URL validation for reliability
- 🎯 High-quality image curation with 90%+ relevance scores

### **User Experience:**
- 🔄 Manual refresh buttons for AI re-verification
- 🏷️ Image source badges (AI Generated vs Verified)
- ⚡ Automatic fallback handling (no user intervention needed)
- 📱 Responsive design with proper error states

### **Error Handling:**
- 🛡️ Graceful degradation when images fail
- 🔄 Multiple retry mechanisms
- 📝 Detailed logging for debugging
- 🎯 Smart fallback selection based on symbol category

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
node run-image-test.js
```

### **Manual Testing Steps:**
1. Select two shape types (e.g., "Ancient symbols" and "Chemical formula symbol")
2. Click "Auto Search" to find symbols
3. Select a search result - image should load automatically
4. If image fails, click the refresh button (↻) for AI verification
5. Click "AI Verify & Generate" button if image is not available
6. Compare button should appear when image loads successfully
7. After comparison, matched symbol should show with AI-enhanced images
