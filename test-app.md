# Testing the Symbol Comparison App - UPDATED

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. âœ… Image Loading Issues
- **Problem**: Images in search results were not showing properly
- **Solution**: 
  - Added AI-powered image search fallback system via tRPC
  - Implemented curated image collections for different symbol types
  - Added proper error handling with automatic fallback to alternative images
  - Added refresh button to manually trigger AI image search
  - Enhanced image loading callbacks to properly notify parent components

### 2. âœ… Compare Button Logic
- **Problem**: Compare button was not properly disabled when image wasn't loaded
- **Solution**:
  - Updated button state logic to check `selectedImageLoaded` and `selectedImageError`

  - Button only enables when image is successfully loaded and clear
  - Added proper state management for image loading states

### 3. âœ… AI Image Search Integration

  - Added AI definition enhancement for better symbol descriptions
  - Added visual indicators for AI-enhanced images with badges
  - Implemented caching (10 min stale time) for performance

### 4. âœ… Floating Symbol Shapes
- **Problem**: Requested symbol-shaped floating elements
- **Solution**:
  - Already implemented in BackgroundDoodles component
  - Includes Star, Pi symbol, Triangle (Delta), and DNA helix shapes
  - 60 animated floating symbols with different speeds and rotations
  - Proper SVG-based shapes with smooth animations

### 5. âœ… Comparison Result Image Display
- **Problem**: Matched symbol image was empty after comparison
- **Solution**:
